            Tuscan pappardelle is a wide, egg-enriched wheat pasta usually served under a blanket of thick, rich sauce (like this caramelized onion rag√π).
        </p>

            <li>7 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>8 cups yellow onions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>

            <li>4 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>16 ounces dried pappardelle or tagliatelle pasta</li>
            <li>shaved Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
              Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a very large, deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or an 8-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss to coat in butter. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, about 15 minutes. Increase heat to high. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions start to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduce heat to medium and add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to darken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine to skillet, then use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pot. Simmer for 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add broth, bay leaves, thyme, crushed red pepper, and cloves. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and onions are jammy, with just a bit of liquid at the edges of skillet, about 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              While sauce simmers, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Remove sauce from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove and discard bay leaves. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes, vinegar, black pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir cooked pasta into warm sauce, adding reserved pasta cooking water a little at a time until sauce is desired thickness. Serve with Parmesan cheese and garnish with thyme.
