        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>Fried Garlic Chicken is a crispy fried chicken in a thick and savoury garlic sauce; this dish is most certainly for the garlic lover. Prepared with a unique battering technique, and double fried, this chicken is sweet and super garlicky – it’s made with twelve cloves of garlic!</p>
