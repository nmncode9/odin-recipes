        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (25-ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups store-bought Alfredo sauce</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled</li>
            <li>3 cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped marinated sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3 quart baking dish with cooking spray. Spread about 1/2 cup sauce on the bottom of the dish and arrange half of the ravioli in a single layer over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with cooked sausage, spinach, and sundried tomatoes. Pour 1 1/2 cups of alfredo sauce over the spinach mixture. Sprinkle with half of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese and top with the remaining ravioli in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Pour over remaining sauce and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake for about 1 hour, uncovering during the last 15 minutes, until golden brown around the edges and bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
